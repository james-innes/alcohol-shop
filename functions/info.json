   "info": "<p>Beer</p><p>Type: Sunshine lager ABV: 4.5%Overall impression: Golden lager, slightly fruity, with a crisp but refreshing bitternessBorn in Mexico and brought up on the beach, Corona is lighter than traditional beers, with a crisp and refreshing taste. The aroma is fruity-honey with a touch of malt and the flavour is crisp and well-balanced between hops and malt, toward the malt side.Whatever the time of year, Corona is best served ice cold and with a wedge of lime, that both complements and intensifies the flavor, with the refreshing citrus notes. Every sip of Corona, conjures images of golden sands and pale blue skies, transporting you to instant relaxation and disconnection.Corona's superior taste profile is due to the fact that our brewers take great care to use only the best ingredients available, made with the finest quality blend of filtered water, malted barley, hops, and yeast.The unmistakable colour, the one-of-a-kind taste, the unparalleled flavor of relaxation makes it 'la cerveza mas fina', made for gathering with friends.Food Pairing RecommendationSubtle flavours and low alcohol intensity means Corona can be overpowered. However, it's fragrant nature and citrus notes, when combined with lime, also make it a great partner for several cuisines: in particular Thai, Chinese and Mexican. The sweetness from the malts is also at the right level to reduce medium heat that can often be found in dishes from these areas.Home-Run Pairing: Nachos Corn Nachos will have flavor matches with the corn used as part of the grain bill for Corona. The carbonation will help cut through any rich and fatty toppings such as avocado, sour cream or cheese, whilst the malt sweetness will offset any moderate heat from jalapenos or other varieties of chillis. Finally the lime added to the corona will add a citrus burst to the nachos as well helping further accentuate the flavors on your palate.</p><p>12 x 1.5 UK Units per bottlePlease Drink ResponsiblyThe UK Chief Medical Officers recommend adults do not regularly drink more than 14 units per week.drinkaware.co.uk for the factsPlease RecycleBrewed under Licence from Cerveceria Modelo, S.

The Belgian way, of course: perfectly poured, sipped from a Chalice, and enjoyed in the company of friends with a nibble of something delicious.Santé!ServingBest served chilled in our iconic Chalice.A medium hop intensity, along with some residual sweetness from its malts makes Stella Artois is a versatile beer when pairing with food.Food PairingStella Artois pairs well with salmon, tuna and marbled meat. Its bitterness offers a pleasing contrast with sweet reductions and sauces and its carbonation means it pairs well with rich and fried foods, as long as their intensity is not too high.Home-Run PairingBeer Battered Fish and ChipsThere are several flavor bridges and complementary elements between Stella Artois and fish and chips. Firstly Stella Artois can actually be used in the cooking stage, with Stella Artois' carbonation adding a lovely lightness to the batter and also a slight cracker and nutty flavours to the dish.The beer's intensity is also just at the right level to stand up against the fried fish without stealing the show or being overwhelmed, whilst the carbonation helps cleanse the palate. The slight floral notes from the hops and residual sweetness from the malts will play nicely alongside the acidity of a squeeze of lemon or a dash of vinegar which often accompanies the fish. Finally, the gentle hop bitterness will offset any sweetness from any complementary mushy peas on the side.</p><p>10 x 2.0 UK Units per canPlease Drink ResponsiblyThe UK Chief Medical Officers recommend adults do not regularly drink more than 14 units per week.drinkaware.co.uk for the factsPlease Recycle</p><p>Alcohol By Volume: 4.6<br />Tasting Notes: With a flavourful taste and a clean finish, Stella Artois is meant to be savoured<br />Serving Suggestion: Best served chilled in our iconic Chalice.

The resulting base wines are then blended by the winemaker to achieve the best balance of freshness and fruit character. Following this process the wine is fermented a second time. As the wine is placed under pressure the carbon dioxide gas that is produced as a bi-product of the fermentation is dissolved in the liquid, this is subsequently released as the bubbles that make the wine sparkle.<br />History: Prosecco began to be made in its modern, light, dry style at some point in the early 1960's. Canti prosecco was born in the early 2000's when Fratelli Martini, a company with a long history of producing high quality prosecco under other labels started the Canti brand.<br />Regional Information: Prosecco is a small sub-region of the Veneto in North Eastern Italy. The vineyards are mainly on hillsides which ensure the vines get good exposure to the ripening warmth and sunlight. The cooling winds that roll down from the alpine region to the North ensure that the grapes don't over ripen and retain the fresh, green fruit characteristics that contribute to the wine's signature style.<br /></p><br /><p>Alcohol By Volume: 11<br />Tasting Notes: Pale straw in colour with bouquet and taste of green apples and flowers<br />Serving Suggestion: Excellent as an aperitif or with lightly salted dishes<br /></p><br /><h4>Categories</h4><p><span>Allergy Advice: May Contain </span><a>Sulphur Dioxide/Sulphites</a></p><div><h4>Ingredients and Allergens</h4><div><p></p><p>Contains Sulphites</p></div><h4>Product Packaging Information</h4><div><p>Type</p><p>Bottle</p></div><h4>Safety Information</h4><div><div><div></div></div><ul><li>Pregnancy Warning</li></ul></div><h4>Handling and Cooking</h4><div><p>\"To enjoy this wine at its best, drink within &lt; &gt; of purchase.\"</p></div><h4>Brand and Supplier Information</h4><div><p>Region of Origin</p><p>Veneto</p><p>Manufacturers Address</p><p>Canti Family S.P.A.,Milano,Italia.</p><p>Return To</p><p>Canti Family S.P.A.,Milano,Italia.www.cantwine.cominfo@cantiwine.com</p></div>"

The entire range of techniques, the maceration process, vinification and blending have been deployed to extract the colour and obtain the best just-picked berry-fruit aromas at every step. This is what guarantees the freshness and liveliness of the wine. After all, Laurent-Perrier can be credited with boldly developing a non-vintage Cuvée Rosé, and, as a result, it has to be perfect - every time. After bottling, it takes a minimum of four years to coax the 75cl bottles of Cuvée Rosé Laurent-Perrier to perfection, and an additional two years for magnums.<br />History: This champagne is famous for its highly expressive bouquet, which steams from the very careful preservation of the grape's natural fresh red fruit aromas. It is one of the rare rosé champagnes to be made using the maceration (skin contact) technique, which gives it the extraordinary depth and freshness that has made it the benchmark for rosé champagne around the world. Revered by wine-lovers for its flavours and by aesthetes for the beauty of its 16th century-style bottle, the Laurent-Perrier Cuvée Rosé is one of the stars in the Laurent-Perrier range.<br />Regional Information: Cuvée Rosé Laurent-Perrier combines a vinous character with great freshness. It can be savoured on its own, and also with many bold food and wine pairings. Tender and ethereal, its bouquet of freshly-picked berry fruits easily surprises, constituting a very pleasant appetiser. Served at a temperature of 8-10°C, it delivers up its rich aromas and pairs with many foods, from starters to dessert. It also goes wonderfully with foie gras canapés topped with red currants, or wafer-thin slivers of finest pata negra ham, and many other dishes, including marinated raw fish and braised guineafowl. It works perfectly at home too, with soft, creamy cheeses such as Chaource, Mussy-sur-Seine, and Langres, and with desserts such as a berry fruit salad.

The must is separated from the solid elements of the skins and decants naturally for 12-24 hours at a temperature of 8-10°C.

   "info": "<p>London dry gin.</p><p>One of the world's best-selling gins, Beefeater London Dry is has won more \"best gin\" awards than any other brand. It is distilled in a traditional London dry style using fine botanicals and master distiller James Burrough's original recipe from the 1800s. Beefeater London Dry Gin has a remarkably clean flavour, with a bold juniper character that is balanced with strong notes of citrus. The distinctive character of Beefeater London Dry Gin is shaped by nine all-natural botanicals: juniper, Seville orange peel, bitter almonds, orris root, coriander seeds, angelica root, licorice, angelica seed, and Sicilian lemon peel. As a result, it is an ideal gin to enjoy with the tonic of your choice or in your favourite gin cocktail.Serving suggestion: For a fresh Gin and Tonic, serve 50ml of Beefeater Dry with Indian tonic water over cubed ice in a hi-ball glass and garnish with lemon and orange slices.</p><p>Alcohol By Volume: 40<br />Units: 28<br />Serving Suggestion: For a fresh Gin and Tonic, serve 50ml of Beefeater Dry with Indian tonic water over cubed ice in a hi-ball glass and garnish with lemon and orange slices.<br /></p><br /><p>Statutory/Years: 18</p><h4>Categories</h4><p><span>Country of Origin </span><a>UNITED KINGDOM</a></p><div><h4>Handling and Cooking</h4><div><p>Usage</p><p>B&amp;T (Beefeater &amp; Tonic)1 part Beefeater dry2-3 parts Fever Tree TonicGarnish with lemon &amp; orange slice</p></div><h4>Brand and Supplier Information</h4><div><p>Based on James Burrough's original 19th century recipe, the botanicals in Beefeater gin are steeped for 24 hours prior to distillation resulting in a complex, yet perfectly balanced gin of depth &amp; integrity.

These are recorded in 1683 in The earliest volume of Horticus Medicus Edinburgensis, a pamphlet compiled by James Sutherland, Superintendent of The Garden at the Time:Juniper (Juniperus Communis) is a Scottish native plant and the backbone to any gin.In Addition to Juniper berries, there are 13 other key botanicals distilled in this unique gin including the classics-:Coriander Seed (Coriandrum sativum), Angelica (Angelica archangelica), Orris Root (Iris germanica var. florentina) and Liquorice Root (glycyrrhiza Glabra).As was customary in the early days of modern medicine, we source some of our botanicals from the Botanic Garden, and others from around the world to give a truly unique drinking experience.Overall Flavour ProfileA very aromatic gin with fresh, herbal (almost floral) notes and a hint of spice. It is smooth on the palette, spicy but sweet, with a tingling aftertaste and a hint of minty freshness.Physic Garden 1670 GINThe Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, affectionately known as 'The Botanics', was first established at a time when plants sat at the heart of medicine. Visionary physician-Botanists Robert Sibbald and Andrew Balfour established a medicinal or 'Physic Garden' in 1670 to train physicians in the safe use and identification of plants.'The Botanics' has been studying plants for around 350 years. In the 21st Century it is a world renowned centre for plant science, horticuture and education, their mission is to 'explore, conserve and explain the world of plants for a better future'.Edinburgh Gin is the perfect partner to embody the science of distilling, as all of our distillers have graduated from the Heriot Watt University's School of Distilling. At Edinburgh Gin we firmly believe that gin distilling is an art that can be perfected by the correct application of science.</p><p>Manufacturers Address</p><p>Produced and bottled by:Edinburgh Gin Distillery,1A Rutland Place,Edinburgh,EH1 2AD.</p><p>Return To</p><p>Edinburgh Gin Distillery,1A Rutland Place,Edinburgh,EH1 2AD.edinburghgindistillery.co.uk</p><h4>Safety Information</h4><div><div><div></div></div><ul><li>Pregnancy Warning</li></ul></div></div>"

The geological foundation of the region is limestone, leading to a soil structure that is heavy in calcium. The Gironde estuary dominates the regions along with its tributaries, the Garonne and the Dordogne rivers, and together irrigates the land and provides an Atlantic Climate, also known as an oceanic climate, for the region. The soil of Bordeaux is composed of gravel, sandy stone, and clay. The region's best vineyards are located on the well drained gravel soils that are frequently found near the Gironde River.</p><h4>Categories</h4><p><span>Storage Type </span><a>Ambient</a></p><div><h4>Features</h4><div><p>• Allergy Advice -Contain's Sulpher Dioxide / Sulphites</p></div>"

The selected grapes then undergo a drying process called “appassimento” which consists in placing the grapes in special boxes inside a room equipped with ventilators, to maintain a constant temperature and humidity. During this process, grapes lose 35% of their weight, but retain and enhance their unique flavors and aromas.<br />History: Most of the wines produced under the Valpolicella DOC are red and usually contain a sizeable amount of the area's most distinguished grape, Corvina.

A complex yet balanced spirit that stimulates the senses and evolves in the glass. Crowned as the best 'Column Still Rum' at the World Rum Awards in 2018, this is a very special rum. Brugal 1888 rum leads the way in double aging. It is a full bodied liquid that rests first in hand-picked ex bourbon American oak casks, followed by a second maturation in European Oak Sherry Casks. Its deep amber colour results in a complex yet balanced rum with a remarkable taste and long smooth finish that evolves in the glass. With over 100 year of crafting their expertise, every bottle of 1888 is overseen by the 5th generation of Master Blenders, each a descendant of the original founder of Brugal. Each bottle is individually tested and packaged by hand. Each bottle is wax dipped and the iconic Brugal netting is applied with care. 1888 is made to be savoured sip by sip. Try it either neat or as a smoky Old Fashioned.</p><p>Manufacturers Address</p><p>Edrington Beam Suntory,191 West George Street,Glasgow,G2 2LD.</p><p>Return To</p><p>Edrington Beam Suntory,191 West George Street,Glasgow,G2 2LD.</p><h4>Product Packaging Information</h4><div><p>Type</p><p>Bottle</p></div><h4>Safety Information</h4><div><div><div></div></div><ul><li>Pregnancy Warning</li><li>Do not drive</li></ul></div></div>"

In 1849, a young wines and spirit entrepreneur called Alfred Lamb took the time and trouble to blend no fewer than 18 superior rums from Barbados, Jamaica, Trinidad and Guyana to create the Navy Dark Rum we now know and love. Wherever the unique and original are valued and celebrated, it stands as one of the few: honest, no-nonsense and an absolute delight in the glass.

At a time where others crudely squeezed sugar beets to make their rum, Alfred fought to define his rum as the spirit distilled from pure sugar cane, venturing across the Caribbean Sea to identify the perfect rum bases. Legend has it that Alfred used a specific bottle shape for his rum so that it wouldn't roll off his ship's table during his rough, courageous voyages.

Try it at home! Aperol was created by the Barbieri brothers and launched in 1919 at the Padua International Fair, soon becoming one of Italy's favorite liqueurs, now taking the world by storm. The original recipe has remain unchanged since 1919.To make the perfect Aperol Spritz, fill a large wine glass with ice.

The golden honeyed liquid is perfect enjoyed on its own, with or without ice and has a delicious lingering warmth.Drambuie traditionally has been served after dinner as a digestif, and was drunk to aid the digestion of food. Drambuie means it complements food well and is ideal to round off the evening or to offer to guests at casual get-togethers as “a little something” extra, during, after, or instead of dessert, as Drambuie pairs well with coffee, cheese and chocolates. Drambuie also makes a great gift for a cherished one.Drambuie is a very versatile spirit that is an ideal choice for when your entertaining guests as it can be used simply to create a range of cocktails and desserts that are easy and impressive. In fact the lingering honeyed warmth of Drambuie is very similar in taste to a trending cocktail, the Old Fashioned; the classic recipe combines whisky, sugar and aromatic bitters, stirred vigorously with ice. Drambuie already combines all of these ingredients but the bitters are replaced with a blend of floral herbs and aromatic spices … plus it's much simpler to prepare, simply add a garnish such as a slice of orange. Mojitos are long and refreshing highball drinks and one of the most popular cocktails. Why not try a Scottish Mojito, simply mix 50ml Drambuie, half a squeezed lemon with fresh mint, top up with lots of ice and pour over soda or sparkling water.</p><p>Alcohol By Volume: 40<br />Units: 28<br />Tasting Notes: A unique blend of aged scotch whisky heather honey herbs &amp; spices<br /></p><br /><p>Statutory/Years: 18</p><h4>Categories</h4><p><span>Country of Origin </span><a>Scotland</a></p><div><h4>Product Packaging Information</h4><div><p>Type</p><p>Bottle</p></div><h4>Safety Information</h4><div><div><div></div></div><ul><li>Pregnancy Warning</li></ul></div><h4>Brand and Supplier Information</h4><div><p>In 1745 Bonnie Prince Charlie landed on the West Coast of Scotland.

Where Celtic monks found refuge raiding Norsemen and early distillers smuggled their illicit 'aquavitae' at Ardbeg's rocky cove. Where the Lords of the Isles ruled much of Scotland between the 12th and 15th centuries - the clan kings whose bloodline continued through the Macdougalls of Ardbeg, the founders of our great and noble whisky. Islay's history is Ardbeg's heritage. The island's past lives in our present.Ardbeg is revered around the world as the peatiest, smokiest, most complex whisky of them all. Yet it does not flaunt the peat; rather the peat gives way to the malt, the natural sweetness of which subtly intrudes, producing perfect balance. The unusual spirit still with its purifier, the only one of its kinds on Islay, is what many believe contributes to this balance and complexity, making Ardbeg the malt to which all others aspire ....truly the Ultimate Islay Malt.Typically most whiskies are chill-filtered and reduced to a strength of 40% abv. Ardbeg 10 years old, however, is non chill-filtered and has a strength of 46% abv, thus retaining maximum flavour, at the same time giving more body and added depth. On adding water a little cloudiness may occur which is perfectly natural and is not a matter for concern.The Untamed Spirit of Islay\"Unquestionably the greatest distillery to be found on Earth.

Unfortunately, due to the avant garde method of oak aging we developed for The Spice Tree, (utilising the highest quality French cooperage oak, we hasten to add), we were compelled by powers greater than us to discontinue the production.Back to France we went, to the Vosges Forest, where we have friends who make some of the very best cooperage oak in the world. Working closely with them we created a bespoke French and American oak cask that would help us achieve similar results to that of the original Spice Tree, but in a way that would be acceptable to even the most conservative of observers.Et voilà, The Spice Tree was resurrected.These bespoke casks are similar to those we use for our whisky Oak Cross, although the toasting levels are higher and the time spent in cask is longer for The Spice Tree. The casks are composed of new French oak for the heads of each cask and used American oak for the bodies of the casks. The Spice Tree is a rich, intensely-flavoured malt whisky, redolent of baking spices such as clove, ginger and cardamom, layered with toasty oak accents that all complement the underlying distillery character of the single malt whiskies we use. Enjoy it on its own or paired with cheeses, chocolates or baked desserts.Enjoy it any way and anytime you like. But, above all, share and enjoy.John Glaser Whiskymaker</p><p>Manufacturers Address</p><p>Compass Box Whisky Co.,24 Great King St.,Edinburgh,Scotland.</p><p>Return To</p><p>Compass Box Whisky Co.,24 Great King St.,Edinburgh,Scotland.www.compassboxwhisky.com</p></div>"

As any expert on blending will tell you, this process makes our Scotch incredibly smooth, with the many subtle layers of flavour in perfect harmony.At Aberfeldy in the heart of the Highlands, John's sons built a distillery to make the Single Malt that shapes the honeyed, rich flavour of our Scotch. There's gold in the water source.... but that's another storyTommy Robert DewarBorn 1864, Tommy Dewar was the maverick brother, a renowned wit and raconteur at the forefront of cocktail culture. He was a genius for publicity, making the first film adverts and travelling the world to extol the virtues of his fine, smooth Scotch.John Alexander DewarBorn in 1856, John Alexander Dewar took the Dewar's helm as a young man of just 24 but his entrepreneurial attitude fitted the times exactly.

Inspired by his peaceful surroundings, he created a single malt whisky of unique complexity and exceptional smoothness. To this day, we celebrate Glenmorangie's provenance in our signet icon. Its intricate patterns echo the beauty of our homeland's ancient Cadboll Stone, skilfully carved from the landscape so long ago.Tallest Stills in ScotlandIn pursuit of the exceptional, we distill Glenmorangie's spirit in Scotland's tallest stills. Their long copper necks allow only the very finest vapours to rise to the top. The result is a wonderfully pure and fragrant spirit, bursting with fruity floral complexity.Casks Used Only TwiceOur refined spirit matures for at least ten years in carefully selected ex-bourbon oak casks, to create a deliciously smooth and rounded whisky. Although some other distilleries may fill casks many times, we only ever use ours twice. And so, we ensure their fullest depths of flavour enrich our single malt.The 16 Men of TainFor more than 170 years, Glenmorangie has been perfected by our craftsmen, The 16 Men of Tain. Passed down through the generations, their skills owe as much to instinct and feel as they do to meticulous, uncompromising precision. In The Original's rounded character, their dedication brings its own reward.A Whisky of RenownThis award-winning single malt delights with a nose of mandarin, lemon and peach softened by vanilla, alongside herbal and floral notes. Silken textures bring forth tastes of creamy vanilla that balance with coconut, almonds and honey, before a gentle, lingering finish.
